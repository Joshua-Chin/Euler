Euler
=====

This repository holds solutions to https://projecteuler.net/ written in python.  Before you dive into these solutions, I urge you to try solving the problems yourself. Quoting the homepage:

"There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself."
